# Brave challange ReadMe

I developed this challange using Lumen. I imported the Google maps polyline library to be able to generate the polyline string. The application is purely api. No User interfaces

The tests are available in the tests folder.

### Running the Solution

```sh
$ php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```
### Running the Unit tests

```sh
$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/ApiTest.php
```

### Database

The app runs on a sqlite database


### API docs

I have also shared a postman collection that has all the request that i have been making to the APP.

The collection can also be found here. [Postman Collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/949588/RznLEvPr).
